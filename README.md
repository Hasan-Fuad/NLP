This project builds a machine-learning system that predicts whether a university student will graduate or drop out, based on academic, demographic, and socio-economic data.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Machine-learning model training (4 classical ML models)

Model benchmarking and visualization

Explainability methods (feature importance + wordcloud)

A prediction application function

A random-student simulation engine

A full automated unit-test suite

This repository demonstrates a complete ML pipeline suitable for academic or applied use
